## üìä Database Structure

### Users Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: "John Smith",
  email: "john@techcorp.com",
  password: "hashed_password",
  role: "admin",
  companyName: "Tech Corp",
  isEmailVerified: true,
  createdAt: Date,
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Jobs Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: "Senior React Developer",
  company: "Tech Corp",
  location: "Remote",
  jobType: "full-time",
  createdBy: ObjectId("user_id"), // Links to Users collection
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Applications Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  jobId: ObjectId("job_id"),
  userId: String,
  coverLetter: String,
  resumeUrl: String,
  status: "pending",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Error
**Issue:** "MongoDB connection error"
**Solution:** Ensure MongoDB is running:
```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB

# Or if using MongoDB Compass, it should start automatically
```

### JWT Token Not Working
**Issue:** "No token provided" or "Invalid token"
**Solution:** 
1. Clear browser localStorage
2. Sign in again to get a fresh token
3. Check browser console for token value

### Can't See Any Jobs as Admin
**Issue:** Empty jobs list
**Solution:** This is correct! You'll only see jobs you've created. Create some jobs first.

### Company Name Required Error
**Issue:** Can't sign up as recruiter
**Solution:** Make sure to fill in the company name field (it appears when you select "Recruiter" role)

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the system** thoroughly with multiple accounts
2. **Customize** the JWT_SECRET in your `.env` file
3. **Configure email service** for email verification (optional)
4. **Add more features**:
   - Dashboard analytics
   - Application status notifications
   - Advanced search filters
   - Company profiles
   - Job applicant tracking

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check MongoDB is running
2. Check backend console for errors
3. Check browser console for frontend errors
4. Verify .env file exists and has correct values
5. Clear browser cache and localStorage

## üéâ Success Criteria

Your system is working correctly when:
- ‚úÖ Multiple recruiters can create accounts
- ‚úÖ Each recruiter sees only their own jobs
- ‚úÖ Job seekers see all jobs from all recruiters
- ‚úÖ Applications are properly filtered by job ownership
- ‚úÖ Edit/Delete operations are restricted to job owners

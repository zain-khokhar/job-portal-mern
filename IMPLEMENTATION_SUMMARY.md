## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create Multiple Recruiters ✅
1. Sign up as Recruiter A (Tech Corp)
2. Sign up as Recruiter B (Design Studio)
3. Verify both accounts created successfully

### Scenario 2: Job Isolation ✅
1. Login as Recruiter A
2. Create 3 jobs for Tech Corp
3. Login as Recruiter B
4. Dashboard should be empty (no Tech Corp jobs visible)
5. Create 3 jobs for Design Studio
6. Login back as Recruiter A
7. Only Tech Corp jobs should be visible

### Scenario 3: Edit/Delete Restrictions ✅
1. Login as Recruiter A
2. Try to edit a job → Should work (own job)
3. Try to delete a job → Should work (own job)
4. Login as Recruiter B
5. Try to edit/delete → Should only work for Design Studio jobs

### Scenario 4: Application Management ✅
1. Sign up as Job Seeker
2. Apply to jobs from both companies
3. Login as Recruiter A
4. View applications → Only see Tech Corp job applications
5. Login as Recruiter B
6. View applications → Only see Design Studio job applications

### Scenario 5: Job Seeker View ✅
1. Login as Job Seeker
2. Browse jobs → Should see ALL jobs from ALL companies
3. Apply to any job → Should work
4. View applications → Should see all own applications

## 📊 Database Schema

### Before
```javascript
// User
{ name, email, password, role }

// Job
{ title, company, location, ... }
```

### After
```javascript
// User
{ 
  name, email, password, role, 
  companyName,  // ← NEW
  isEmailVerified, ...
}

// Job
{ 
  title, company, location, ...,
  createdBy: ObjectId  // ← NEW (links to User)
}
```

---

## 🎓 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Recruiter Signs Up**
   ```
   User → Sign Up → Select "Recruiter" → Enter Company Name
   → Backend creates user with role="admin" and companyName
   → JWT token generated and returned
   → Token stored in localStorage
   ```

2. **Recruiter Creates Job**
   ```
   User → Create Job Form → Submit
   → Frontend sends request with JWT token in header
   → Backend verifies token, extracts user ID
   → Job created with createdBy = user ID
   → Job saved to database
   ```

3. **Recruiter Views Jobs**
   ```
   User → Admin Dashboard
   → Frontend requests GET /api/jobs/admin/my-jobs with token
   → Backend verifies token, extracts user ID
   → Query: Job.find({ createdBy: user ID })
   → Returns only this admin's jobs
   ```

4. **Recruiter Manages Applications**
   ```
   User → View Applications
   → Frontend requests GET /api/applications with token
   → Backend gets admin's job IDs
   → Query: Application.find({ jobId: { $in: adminJobIds } })
   → Returns only applications for admin's jobs
   ```

5. **Job Seeker Views Jobs**
   ```
   User → Browse Jobs
   → Frontend requests GET /api/jobs (no token needed)
   → Backend returns ALL jobs from ALL admins
   → Job seeker sees complete marketplace
   ```

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

### For Existing Jobs (Without createdBy)

**Issue:** Old jobs don't have `createdBy` field

**Solutions:**

**Option 1: Assign to Default Admin**
```javascript
// Run this migration script
const User = require('./models/User');
const Job = require('./models/newJobs');

async function migrate() {
  // Create default admin
  const admin = await User.create({
    name: 'Default Admin',
    email: 'admin@company.com',
    password: 'changeme',
    role: 'admin',
    companyName: 'Your Company',
    isEmailVerified: true
  });
  
  // Assign all orphaned jobs
  await Job.updateMany(
    { createdBy: { $exists: false } },
    { $set: { createdBy: admin._id } }
  );
}
```

**Option 2: Delete Old Data**
```javascript
// If test data, just delete
await Job.deleteMany({ createdBy: { $exists: false } });
```

## 💡 Key Improvements Over Old System

| Feature | Old System | New System |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Admins | Single hardcoded | Unlimited database users |
| Authentication | Env variables | JWT tokens |
| Job Ownership | None | Tracked per admin |
| Data Isolation | None | Complete isolation |
| Security | Basic | JWT + bcrypt + authorization |
| Scalability | Limited | Unlimited |
| Company Info | Not tracked | Required for recruiters |
| API Structure | Mixed | RESTful + protected |

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "No token provided"**
- Solution: Clear localStorage and login again

**2. "MongoDB connection error"**
- Solution: Ensure MongoDB is running

**3. "Can't see any jobs as admin"**
- Solution: This is correct! Create jobs first.

**4. "Company name required"**
- Solution: Select Recruiter role and fill company name

**5. Token expired**
- Solution: Login again (tokens last 7 days)

### Check Health

**Backend:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/test
# Should return: {"message": "Server is working"}
```

**MongoDB:**
```bash
# Check if MongoDB is running
# Windows: Services → MongoDB
# Or: mongo
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
# Open browser console
localStorage.getItem('authToken')
# Should show token or null
```

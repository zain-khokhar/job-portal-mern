## 🧪 Quick Test Scenario

### Test 1: Create Two Recruiters

1. Sign up as john@techcorp.com (Recruiter, Tech Corp)
2. Sign up as sarah@design.com (Recruiter, Design Studio)
```

### Test 2: Post Jobs
```
1. Login as John → Create 3 jobs
2. Login as Sarah → Dashboard empty → Create 3 jobs
3. Login as John → Only see Tech Corp jobs (not Sarah's)
```

### Test 3: Applications
```
1. Sign up as job seeker
2. Apply to both companies' jobs
3. Login as John → See only Tech Corp applications
4. Login as Sarah → See only Design Studio applications
```

## 🔐 Authentication Headers

All protected endpoints require:
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

Token received on signup/signin:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "user": { ... }
  }
}
```

---

## 📝 Sign Up Examples

### Job Seeker
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "securePass123",
  "role": "user"
}
```

### Recruiter
```json
{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane@company.com",
  "password": "securePass123",
  "role": "admin",
  "companyName": "Tech Company"  ← Required!
}
```

---

## 🎨 UI Changes

- Company name field appears for Recruiter
- Visual role indicators

### Admin Dashboard
- Shows only logged-in admin's jobs
- "My Jobs" counter

## ⚡ Important Notes

1. **Company Name Required** for recruiters
2. **JWT Token** stored in localStorage
3. **7-day expiration** on tokens
4. **Email verification** recommended but optional
5. **Admins isolated** - can't see each other's data

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No token provided | Login again |
| Can't see jobs | Create jobs first (admins see only own jobs) |
| Company name error | Must select Recruiter role and enter company |
| MongoDB error | Ensure MongoDB is running |
| Token expired | Login again (7-day limit) |

---

## 📊 Data Flow

### Create Job
```
User → Frontend (+ token) → Backend verifies token
→ Extract user ID → Create job with createdBy
→ Save to MongoDB → Return success
```

### View Jobs (Admin)
```
Admin → GET /api/jobs/admin/my-jobs (+ token)
→ Backend verifies token → Extract user ID
→ Query: Job.find({ createdBy: userID })
→ Return only admin's jobs
```

### View Jobs (Job Seeker)
```
User → GET /api/jobs (no token needed)
→ Backend: Job.find() - all jobs
→ Return ALL jobs from ALL recruiters
```
